                        This blog was created in the hope of sharing useful information with the cat lovers community.
                        <br />Thank you for stopping by here for a moment, hopefully you will soon be a familiar guest of my home. Love all.

                        Quilty the cat is quite the character. He will not be contained, and insists on freeing his fellow felines from their room.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This smart tabby first came to Friends For Life, a no-kill shelter in Houston, Texas, as a kitten. From day one, they noticed his larger-than-life personality. Quilty found a home but was later returned to the shelter because his owner was relocating and unable to take him with.

                    <p>
                        The shelter took him back with open arms and placed him in a kitty suite with a few other feline roommates. But little did they know this tabby boy has zero tolerance to closed doors.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "We came in one morning to find that the door to our front cat room was open. Of course, all of the cats that had previously been inside said room were now hanging out around the shelter," Jennifer Hopkins, Communications lead of Friends for Life, told Love Meow.
                        <br />
                        Morning cat wrangling was not an easy task to say the least. "They really had no interest in going back in (except when we started to crack open the cans of wet food)."
